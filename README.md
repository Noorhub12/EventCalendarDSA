# Event Calendar (DSA Project)

This project implements a simple event calendar system in C using linked list data structures. It allows users to manage events by adding, deleting, updating, and viewing them in chronological order. Events can also be saved to and loaded from a file for persistent storage.

- **View Events**: Display all events sorted by date and time.
- **Save/Load Events**: Store events to a file or retrieve them from a file for data persistence.
- **Clear All Events**: Remove all events from the calendar.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C
- Data Structures: Doubly Linked List
- Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Updating
- File Handling: Reading from and writing to files

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Compile the program using a C compiler (`gcc` recommended).
2. **Run**: Execute the compiled executable to start the event calendar.
3. **Menu Options**: Follow the on-screen menu to perform desired operations on events.
4. **File Operations**: Use save and load options to store events in a file or load events from a file.
